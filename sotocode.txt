copy whole program into one long array.
get rid of all white space
search string for you ints bools etc.
example:	
    when you get to an i get next two chars and string compare them to int
    if they match get the next word up to a ( or , or ; if its a bracket ( skip all chars
    until u get to the ) bracket.  if its a , u know there are more ints after it until
    u get to a ; so just add the ,'s 
you can do this through the whole string using something like swtich statements.

for the array u can dinamicly allocate space using the new operator (i think)
if not create a static size of 1000 or something.
